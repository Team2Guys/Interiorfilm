    title:"Here's how you can apply Architectural Vinyl Wrap:",
    details: [
      "Start by cutting the vinyl to the right size for your project. Once you have that, line up the vinyl on the surface you're working on. Peel back about 10-15 cm of the backing paper from the top of the vinyl. Stick that top strip to the item, making sure it's lined up properly.",
      "Now, as you continue, pull the backing paper down from underneath while using a squeegee on top to smooth the vinyl onto the surface. If you notice any air bubbles, just push them out with the squeegee towards the nearest edge.",
      "If your project has curves or bends, you can use a heat gun to gently warm up the vinyl, which will make it easier to stretch and wrap around the curve. It's a good idea to overlap the vinyl at the back of the object to keep it more secure. If you're feeling unsure, try practicing with a smaller piece of vinyl before moving on to a larger project.",
      "Since this vinyl is thicker than regular types, we recommend using an adhesive promoter like 3M 94 Primer on any edges, bends, or recessed areas. This will help the vinyl stick better and last longer. You can find this primer from your local 3M distributor or buy it online.",
      "For surfaces like worktops or tables, avoid placing hot pans directly on the vinyl. Use coasters and placemats for hot cups and plates to help the wrap last longer.",
      "Lastly, after applying the vinyl, give it at least 3 hours to settle before using the surface. Keeping the air conditioning on will also help the wrap stick properly.",
